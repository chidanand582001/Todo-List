        <p>  <h4>Make it fast to add and organize tasks.</h4> Ideally, a task is added and categorized in a couple taps or keystrokes.

<h4>Offer multiple ways to organize your tasks.</h4> Tags, lists, projects, and due dates are all helpful, and the best apps offer at least a few categories like this.

<h4>Remind you about self-imposed deadlines.</h4> Notifications, widgets, emailsâ€”the best applications make it obvious when something needs to be completed.

<h4>Offer clean user interfaces.</h4> Well-designed to-do apps fit into your workflow so you can get back to what you're supposed to be doing.

<h4>Sync between every platform you use.</h4> Which platforms will depend on what you personally use, but we didn't consider anything that doesn't sync between desktop and mobile.</p>
